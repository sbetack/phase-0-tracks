# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows you to save and access previous version of the same file. It is useful for backing up your code and de-bugging.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is basically a copy of a file. Branches are useful when you are making changes because the changes can be made in a version branch. Once the changes are complete, this version branch is then merged back into the master. Branches are also useful when multiple people are making changes simultaneously. As everyone completes their changes they can merge them back into the master branch.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Commit saves a version to the git repository. A good commit message describes exactly what change was made in this version.
* What is a merge conflict? :) :) :) :) :)
Merge conflict is when two separate branches make different changes to the same code, and then are merged back together.

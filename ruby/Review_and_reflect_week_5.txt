Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?

	Data structures are useful in programming because they allow you to store data in multiple different ways. Arrays allow you to list items in a group together. Hashes allow to list pairs of items in a group together. 

Arrays
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.

	An array is a group of items separated by commas listed between  [ ]. Array's keep items listed in a specific order.

3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.
	ex1: A list of student test scores on a final exam.
	ex2: A list of lunch orders from an office.

Hashes
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.

	A hash is a group of paired items (key and values). Each key points to it's value.

5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.
	ex1: A list of items in a store that point to their prices.
	ex2: A form that matches questions with responses.

Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?

	Iteration is useful because it allows programmers to look through all of the items in an array or hash individually. 

7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.
	
	When Will Ferrell in Elf is testing all of the jack-in-the-boxes. He takes each box, cranks it threes times, then marks down whether or not the clown pops out.


Blocks
8. What is a block?

	A block is a group of code that gets passed through a method. It is initialized with { } (when it's one line) or do/end (when its more than one line).

9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from?

	A block parameter is a variable that is used in the code of the block. The parameter comes from the object that you are calling it on.
